\subsection{Homework 3}
1. (a) Let $G$ be a cyclic group with generator $g$. That is, $G = (g)$. Now, suppose $H \subset G$ is a subgroup of $G$. Let $k$ be the smallest positive integer such that $g^k \in H$. We will show that $H$ is generated by $g^k$, and therefore cyclic.

Given any $h \in H \subset G$, we know $h = g^m$ for some $m \in \Z$. Then $m = pk + r$, for some integers $p$ and $r$ where $0 \leq r < k$. But since $g^{-k} \in H$, and therefore $g^{-pk} \in H$, we see that $g^{pk + r}g^{-pk} = g^r \in H$. However, we assumed $k$ was the smallest such positive integer, so $r$ must be 0. It follows that any $h \in H$ is generated by $g^k$. Thus $H = (g^k)$ is a cyclic subgroup in $G$.
